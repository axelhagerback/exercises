# exercises

All 5 exercises are done!

On exercise 1 and 2 I used a while loop in the beginning but changed it to a foreach loop.

On exercise 2 I made 1 array and reversed the order later by creating a new variable.

On exercise 3 I only put in the letters in the map that I wanted to have in my sentence; "Hej jag heter Axel".
